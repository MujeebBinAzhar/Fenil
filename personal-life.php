                        Dr. Priya Shah, M.A. & Ph.D. in Marriage Consultancy (U.S.A.),
                        has been running a marriage bureau in Mumbai, India, and abroad
                        since 1991 under the establishment ‘Arrange Love Marriage’ an
                        international marriage bureau, with office branches in Mumbai
                        and New York. Over the past 33 years, she has built immense
                        trust and goodwill and is proud to announce that ‘Arrange Love
                        Marriage’ has successfully matched over 9000 couples, helping
                        them find their ideal partners.

                    <p>
                        In 1991, I began my journey into matchmaking, starting as a
                        social service within my family, friends, and social circle
                        without charging any fees. I believed that both individuals
                        involved should have a choice in their marriage, which was
                        contrary to the prevailing beliefs at that time. With a deep
                        interest in bettering society through stronger relationships, I
                        took on the role of a matchmaker and gradually increased the
                        number of happy marriages around me. Blessed by the gratitude of
                        these happy couples and driven by destiny, my matchmaking
                        activities continued to grow, motivating me to keep moving
                        forward.

                        As the number of successful matches grew, my reputation as a
                        matchmaker spread through referrals and word-of-mouth publicity.
                        With the increasing demand for my services, I began charging a
                        nominal fee. Working with people from different religions,
                        castes, preferences, intellects, and natures helped me build my
                        expertise in matchmaking. My clients are highly qualified
                        professionals, including doctors, engineers, MBAs, chartered
                        accountants, architects, and well-known business owners, from
                        diverse Hindu backgrounds such as Gujarati, Punjabi, Sindhi,
                        Bengali, South Indian, Marwari-Agarwal, Maheshwari, Gupta, and
                        Jain. They are well-established in Mumbai, other Indian metro
                        cities, and abroad in countries like the USA, UK, Dubai,
                        Singapore, Australia, and Africa.

                        Marriage often involves a lifetime commitment, which can be a
                        matter of concern for singles and their parents, leading to many
                        questions and confusion. I began counseling these candidates and
                        their parents to prepare them for marriage, ensuring they end up
                        with the right life partner.

                    <p>
                        As a happily married woman since 1990, I have learned many
                        lessons through my own experiences. In 2004, I decided to
                        document these learnings and pearls of wisdom, launching my own
                        publication covering everything one needs to know about
                        marriage. As a true contribution to society, I decided to keep
                        this publication free of cost. It covers various aspects such as
                        adjusting to a new family, compromises and changes after
                        marriage, balancing career and familial demands, leveraging the
                        multitasking potential inherently found in women, and raising
                        children in contemporary times.

                        Through over a decade of interacting with people contemplating
                        marriage, counseling them, and addressing their problems, I
                        gained a deep understanding of their concerns and thought
                        processes. I wanted to pass on my knowledge and secrets to a
                        happy married life through this publication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I have a track record of making happy marriages, I also
                        ensure that they are long-lasting. I am known for making the
                        perfect match where couples commit to a lifetime of
                        togetherness. Realizing how I could successfully help those who
                        approached me, I asked myself how I could help others on a
                        larger scale. I had a strong desire to contribute towards Indian
                        society, especially as Indians have settled all over the world.
                        This was another driving factor behind launching my publication.
                        It documents my experiences as well as those of my clients.

                        This is the first and only publication exclusively dedicated to
                        marriages, serving as a comprehensive knowledge book on marriage
                        for Indians. This complete knowledge on marriage book is my gift
                        to society, as I firmly believe that happy marriages are the
                        foundation of a bright future. The lives couples lead and the
                        arguments they have are direct examples to their children,
                        deeply impacting their outlook on marriage and life in general.
                        It is important to raise our children, the future of India, with
                        the right intellect, values, and thought process, which first
                        comes from their parents and upbringing. In my words, “Happy
                        marriages make happy parents, who make happy children, who
                        become better citizens of India!”

                        Now, with a 27-year-old son, I can focus completely on my
                        passion for transforming and bettering the marriage and
                        matchmaking system. This mission is the most important part of
                        my life, and I am dedicated to making significant contributions
                        to ensure a happier and more fulfilling journey for every
                        couple.
